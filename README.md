# Bio-sensor electrical current model

Goal of this project is to model bio sensor current when submerged in substrate.

## Building and running
This project uses ```make``` for building

To build and run use ```./run.sh```

## Testing
For testing Google C++ Testing Framework is used.

Before running tests clone Google Test repository to a nearby location from
https://github.com/google/googletest

To run tests use ```./test.sh```

## Plotting

Plots are generated by gnuplots.
Make sure it is installed on your machine before running.
To display plots run ```./plot.sh```


## ToDo
- Create exception classes
- Create scripts for visualising results with Octave or similar tool
- Write ElementsAreArray implementation for double arrays
- Add code profiling
